        "Prevent unauthorised transactions in your account. Update your mobile
        numbers/email IDs with your stock brokers. Receive information of your
        transactions directly from Exchange on your mobile/email at the end of
        the day. Issued in the interest of investors. KYC is one time exercise
        while dealing in securities markets – once KYC is done through a SEBI
        registered intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not
        undergo the same process again when you approach another intermediary."
        Dear Investor, if you are subscribing to an IPO, there is no need to
        issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and sign the IPO
        application form to authorize your bank to make payment in case of
        allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain in your bank
        account. Do not share your trading credentials (User ID and Password)
        with anyone. Stock brokers can accept securities as margin from clients
        only by way of pledge in the depository system. If you find anyone
        claiming to be part of Zerodha and offering such services, please report
        immediately.
